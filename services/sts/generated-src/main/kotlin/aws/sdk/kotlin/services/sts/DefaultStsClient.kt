     * Returns a set of temporary security credentials that you can use to access Amazon Web Services
     * resources that you might not normally have access to. These temporary credentials
     * consist of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token. Typically, you
     * use AssumeRole within your account or for cross-account access. For a
     * comparison of AssumeRole with other API operations that produce temporary
     * credentials, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html">Requesting Temporary Security
     * Credentials and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison">Comparing
     * the STS API operations in the
     * IAM User Guide.
     * Permissions
     * The temporary security credentials created by AssumeRole can be used to
     * make API calls to any Amazon Web Services service with the following exception: You cannot call the
     * STS GetFederationToken or GetSessionToken API
     * operations.
     * (Optional) You can pass inline or managed <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session">session policies to
     * this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an inline session
     * policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policies to use as managed session policies.
     * The plaintext that you use for both inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048
     * characters. Passing policies to this operation returns new
     * temporary credentials. The resulting session's permissions are the intersection of the
     * role's identity-based policy and the session policies. You can use the role's temporary
     * credentials in subsequent Amazon Web Services API calls to access resources in the account that owns
     * the role. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those allowed
     * by the identity-based policy of the role that is being assumed. For more information, see
     * <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session">Session
     * Policies in the IAM User Guide.
     * To assume a role from a different account, your account must be trusted by the
     * role. The trust relationship is defined in the role's trust policy when the role is
     * created. That trust policy states which accounts are allowed to delegate that access to
     * users in the account.
     * A user who wants to access a role in a different account must also have permissions that
     * are delegated from the user account administrator. The administrator must attach a policy
     * that allows the user to call AssumeRole for the ARN of the role in the other
     * account. If the user is in the same account as the role, then you can do either of the
     * following:
     * Attach a policy to the user (identical to the previous user in a different
     * account).
     * Add the user as a principal directly in the role's trust policy.
     * In this case, the trust policy acts as an IAM resource-based policy. Users in the same
     * account as the role do not need explicit permission to assume the role. For more
     * information about trust policies and resource-based policies, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html">IAM Policies in
     * the IAM User Guide.
     * Tags
     * (Optional) You can pass tag key-value pairs to your session. These tags are called
     * session tags. For more information about session tags, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html">Passing Session Tags in STS in the
     * IAM User Guide.
     * An administrator must grant you the permissions necessary to pass session tags. The
     * administrator can also create granular permissions to allow you to pass only specific
     * session tags. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_attribute-based-access-control.html">Tutorial: Using Tags
     * for Attribute-Based Access Control in the
     * IAM User Guide.
     * You can set the session tags as transitive. Transitive tags persist during role
     * chaining. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html#id_session-tags_role-chaining">Chaining Roles
     * with Session Tags in the IAM User Guide.
     * Using MFA with AssumeRole
     * (Optional) You can include multi-factor authentication (MFA) information when you call
     * AssumeRole. This is useful for cross-account scenarios to ensure that the
     * user that assumes the role has been authenticated with an Amazon Web Services MFA device. In that
     * scenario, the trust policy of the role being assumed includes a condition that tests for
     * MFA authentication. If the caller does not include valid MFA information, the request to
     * assume the role is denied. The condition in a trust policy that tests for MFA
     * authentication might look like the following example.
     * "Condition": {"Bool": {"aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent": true}}
     * For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/MFAProtectedAPI.html">Configuring MFA-Protected API Access
     * in the IAM User Guide guide.
     * To use MFA with AssumeRole, you pass values for the
     * SerialNumber and TokenCode parameters. The
     * SerialNumber value identifies the user's hardware or virtual MFA device.
     * The TokenCode is the time-based one-time password (TOTP) that the MFA device
     * produces.
